Hello,

Excited to share my final portfolio this term - it's made of 3 main components being routed through the app.jsx.

The content that can be updated and maintained is mostly rendered through the array data that is located in the page that it pertains to.

For example, the projects data array can be found in the  Projectdetails component.
The about me information can be found in the About.jsx - so on and so forth.

I used react bits, so the crosshair, Threads background, and infinite scroll are pre made components that I adjusted for my use.
I had to optimize the Threads background, because the intial version uses web GL and can affect performance. I did this using co-pilot.

The main methods I used to create this project are all methods unique to react - that we were taught or exposed to in webscripting and webscripting 2.
The main techniques that I have most handy for a portfolio build are the map method, lazy loading, and conditional rendering.

On my home page, there is a conditional render to swap the UI interface completely, so desktop views and mobile views are unique experiences.
On my about page, there is a conditional render to swap the UI to be text focused - with the option to open the infinite scrolling gallery of images.

My contact page, remains the same.
The entire experience is optimized for mobile and desktop viewing.

I implemented a function to scroll the top on page navigation called scrolltotop, and include it in the app.jsx so that children components would also be affected by the function.

You have seen my progression from term 1 - term 3 and with your feedback I was able to create something functional and visually appealing.

Thank you. Hope you enjoy!
